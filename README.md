## What is OpenAgentFramework?

OpenAgentFramework turns your GitHub repository into a self-improving codebase. It provides **autonomous AI agent personas** — Developer, QA, and Development Manager — that continuously monitor your GitHub issues, analyze problems, write production-quality code, and submit pull requests for your review.

**The key idea:** GitHub is the coordination layer. Issues are the work queue. Labels signal state. Comments enable human-in-the-loop feedback. Claude is the AI engine that reads, reasons, and writes code. You stay in control — agents propose changes via pull requests, and nothing merges without your approval.

### Why OpenAgentFramework?

- **Zero-friction deployment** — Create an agent in the control plane UI, download the binary, paste your config, and run. Your agent starts picking up issues within minutes.
- **Run anywhere with ngrok** — Built-in ngrok tunnel support exposes your local control plane to the internet. Agents on remote machines, cloud VMs, or CI runners connect back securely — no port forwarding, firewall rules, or cloud hosting required. Just paste your authtoken in Settings and go.
- **Centralized management** — Configure, monitor, and control all your agents from a single web dashboard. No more editing YAML files on individual machines.
- **Human-in-the-loop by design** — Agents create pull requests, not direct commits. You review, comment, and merge on your terms.
- **Smart decomposition** — Complex issues are automatically broken down into manageable subtasks. The agent estimates complexity and splits work when needed.
- **Self-improving** — When idle, agents enter creative thinking mode, scanning your codebase for improvements and filing suggestion issues.
- **Production-grade observability** — Structured logging, correlation IDs, metrics, circuit breakers, and retry with exponential backoff on every external call.

## Getting Started

### Recommended: Centralized Control Plane (Production)

The recommended way to run OpenAgentFramework is with the **centralized control plane**. This gives you a web UI for managing agents, real-time monitoring, and remote configuration — no YAML editing on individual machines.

#### 1. Start the Control Plane

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaskaj/OpenAgentFramework.git
cd OpenAgentFramework
docker compose up -d
```

This starts PostgreSQL, the control plane API server, and the React frontend. Open **http://localhost:5173** to access the UI.

#### 1b. (Optional) Enable Public Access with ngrok

Want to run agents on remote machines? Enable the built-in ngrok tunnel:

1. Sign up at [ngrok.com](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) (free tier is fine)
2. Go to **Settings** in the control plane UI (`http://localhost:5173/settings`)
3. Paste your [ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) and click **Save**

A public URL like `https://random-name.ngrok-free.dev` appears within seconds. Use this URL as the `controlplane.url` in agent configs on any machine — no port forwarding or cloud deployment needed.

> **Full guide:** [ngrok Tunnel Guide](docs/controlplane/ngrok-tunnel.md)

#### 2. Create Your Organization

Register an account, create an organization, and invite your team.

#### 3. Create an Agent

In the control plane UI, click **Create Agent** — choose a name, type, and target GitHub repository. The UI will provide:
- An **API key** for the agent to authenticate
- A **minimal configuration file** pre-filled with the control plane URL
- **Download instructions** for the agent binary

#### 4. Run the Agent

```bash
# Download or build the agent binary
make build

# Run with the minimal remote config
./bin/agentctl start --config configs/config.remote.yaml
```

The agent connects to the control plane, fetches its full configuration, and starts processing issues.

> **Remote config template:** See [`configs/config.remote.yaml`](configs/config.remote.yaml) for the minimal configuration needed.
>
> **Full remote config docs:** [Remote Configuration Guide](docs/configuration/remote-configuration.md)

### Alternative: Standalone Mode (Development)

For local development or simple single-agent setups, you can run without the control plane using a local YAML config file:

```bash
cp configs/config.example.yaml configs/config.yaml
# Edit with your GitHub token, Anthropic API key, and repo details

make build
./bin/agentctl start --config configs/config.yaml
```

### Developer Agent Workflow

The developer agent follows a structured state machine:

```
idle → claim → workspace → analyze → [decompose] → implement → commit → PR → validation → review → complete
```

1. **Poll** for issues labeled `agent:ready`
2. **Claim** the issue (label: `agent:claimed`, assign self)
3. **Clone** the repository into an isolated workspace
4. **Analyze** the issue with Claude — produce an implementation plan
5. **Decompose** complex issues into subtask issues (when estimated effort exceeds threshold)
6. **Implement** the solution — Claude uses tools to read, edit, search, and write files
7. **Commit & Push** changes to a feature branch
8. **Create a PR** linking back to the issue
9. **Validate** the changes and await human review

When no issues are available and creativity mode is enabled, the agent enters **creative thinking** — scanning the codebase for improvements and filing suggestion issues for your review.

> **Deep dive:** [Developer Workflow Guide](docs/guides/developer-workflow.md)

### Label Protocol

Agents coordinate entirely through GitHub labels — no external message bus required:

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `agent:ready` | Issue available for an agent to claim |
| `agent:claimed` | Agent has taken ownership |
| `agent:in-progress` | Implementation underway |
| `agent:in-review` | PR created, awaiting human review |
| `agent:failed` | Processing failed (see comments for details) |
| `agent:suggestion` | Creativity engine suggestion |
| `agent:subtask` | Child issue from decomposition |
| `agent:epic` | Parent issue that was decomposed |

### Claude Tool Definitions

The developer agent provides Claude with 6 tools for interacting with the codebase:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `read_file` | Read file contents from the workspace |
| `edit_file` | Search-and-replace editing (old_string must be unique) |
| `write_file` | Create or overwrite a file |
| `search_files` | Regex search across the workspace (up to 50 results) |
| `list_files` | List directory contents |
| `run_command` | Execute shell commands in the workspace |

## Key Design Decisions

### GitHub as the Coordination Layer

Rather than building a custom task queue or message broker, OpenAgentFramework uses GitHub itself as the source of truth. Issues are tasks. Labels are state. PRs are deliverables. This means:
- **Full transparency** — every action is visible in your GitHub timeline
- **No vendor lock-in** — your work items and history live in GitHub, not a proprietary system
- **Natural collaboration** — humans and agents use the same interface

### Human-in-the-Loop by Default

Agents never push directly to protected branches. Every change goes through a pull request, giving you full control over what gets merged. You can comment on PRs to provide feedback, and agents will see your comments on subsequent runs.

### Error Resilience

Every external API call (GitHub, Claude, control plane) is wrapped with:
- **Exponential backoff retry** with jitter
- **Circuit breakers** that trip after consecutive failures
- **Error classification** to distinguish transient vs permanent failures
- **Graceful degradation** — agents continue operating even if the control plane is temporarily unreachable

> **Details:** [Error Recovery Guide](docs/observability/error-recovery.md)

### Repository Memory

Agents learn from your codebase over time. After each successful implementation, Claude extracts architectural patterns, conventions, and gotchas into a persistent per-repository memory store. This context is injected into future conversations, making the agent increasingly effective.
