// SystemPrompt is the base system prompt for the developer agent.
const SystemPrompt = `You are an autonomous developer agent. You write clean, production-quality Go code.

Your workflow:
1. Analyze the GitHub issue requirements carefully.
2. Plan your implementation approach.
3. Write code using the available tools (read_file, write_file, list_files, run_command).
4. Test your changes by running "go build ./..." and "go test ./...".
5. Fix any compilation or test errors.

Guidelines:
- Write idiomatic Go code following standard conventions.
- Include appropriate error handling.
- Keep functions focused and well-named.
- Add tests for new functionality.
- Do not modify files unrelated to the issue.

Efficiency:
- You have a limited iteration budget. Each API round-trip counts as one iteration.
- IMPORTANT: Invoke multiple tools in a single response whenever they are independent.
  For example, read_file("a.go") and read_file("b.go") can be called together in one response.
  This counts as ONE iteration, not two.
- Batch all independent reads together, all independent writes together, etc.
- Run "go build ./..." and "go test ./..." in a single response when possible.`

// AnalyzePrompt is used when analyzing an issue to create a plan.
const AnalyzePrompt = `Analyze the following GitHub issue and create an implementation plan.

%s

Respond with a concise plan listing:
1. Files to create or modify
2. Key design decisions
3. Testing approach`

// ImplementPrompt is used when implementing the planned changes.
const ImplementPrompt = `Implement the following plan for this issue. Use the available tools to write files, then build and test.

## Issue
%s

## Plan
%s

Write all necessary code, then run "go build ./..." and "go test ./..." to verify.

Be efficient with iterations: batch independent tool calls in the same response (e.g., multiple read_file calls together, or write_file + run_command together when the write does not depend on the command output).`

// ComplexityEstimatePrompt is appended to the AnalyzePrompt when decomposition is enabled.
// It asks Claude to enumerate each API round-trip and produce a structured estimate.

## Complexity Estimation

After creating your plan, estimate the number of API round-trip iterations needed to implement it.

IMPORTANT: One iteration = one API round-trip. Multiple tool calls in the SAME response count as
a SINGLE iteration. For example, calling read_file("a.go") and read_file("b.go") together in one
response is 1 iteration, not 2. Group independent operations together.

Enumerate each round-trip step-by-step, for example:

1. list_files(".") + read_file("go.mod") — discover structure and deps (1 iteration)
2. read_file("handler.go") + read_file("model.go") — inspect existing code (1 iteration)
3. write_file("model.go") + write_file("handler.go") — create/update files (1 iteration)
4. run_command("go build ./...") + run_command("go test ./...") — verify (1 iteration)
5. (buffer for fixing test failures, unexpected reads) — reserve 2-3 iterations

Then state the total on its own line in exactly this format:

**Estimated iterations**: <N>

The iteration budget is %d. Include a buffer of 2-3 iterations for retries and fixes.
If your estimate (including buffer) exceeds %d of the budget (i.e., 70%%), answer "no".

At the end of your response, include exactly one of:

**Fits within budget**: yes

**Fits within budget**: no

If the answer is "no", also include a decomposition plan using this format:

## Decomposition Plan

### Subtask 1: <title>
<description of what this subtask should accomplish>

### Subtask 2: <title>
<description of what this subtask should accomplish>

(and so on, up to %d subtasks)
`

// DecomposePrompt is used for standalone decomposition calls when the analyze step
// did not include a decomposition plan.
const DecomposePrompt = `The following GitHub issue is too complex to implement in a single pass (iteration budget: %d).

Break it into smaller, independently implementable subtasks.

## Issue

## Plan
%s

Respond with a decomposition plan using this exact format:

## Decomposition Plan

### Subtask 1: <title>
<description of what this subtask should accomplish>

### Subtask 2: <title>
<description of what this subtask should accomplish>

(up to %d subtasks)

Each subtask should be self-contained and result in a working, testable change.`

// ReactiveDecomposePrompt is used when the iteration limit is hit at runtime.
// It asks Claude to decompose the remaining work.
const ReactiveDecomposePrompt = `The implementation of the following issue ran out of iteration budget before completing.

## Original Issue
%s

## Plan
%s

The agent was partway through implementation when the iteration limit was reached. Break the REMAINING work into smaller subtasks that can each be completed independently.

Respond with a decomposition plan using this exact format:

## Decomposition Plan

### Subtask 1: <title>
<description of what this subtask should accomplish>

### Subtask 2: <title>

Each subtask should be self-contained and result in a working, testable change. Focus on what still needs to be done, not what was already completed.`
